# Photoshop Lite

Photoshop Lite is a lightweight, web-based photo editing application built with React. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard React application structure. Here's a brief overview:

- `src/`: This directory contains all the React components and CSS files. The main application component is `App.js`.
  - `App.css`: Contains the global styles for the application.
  - `Header.js`: Contains the Header component which is responsible for rendering the header of the application.
- `public/`: This directory contains the static files like `index.html` and images.
- `package.json`: This file contains the list of project dependencies and scripts.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies the files and directories that should be ignored by Git.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
